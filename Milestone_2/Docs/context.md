## Context

EnrollmentSystem is a part of a larger student information system (SIS). It allows students, teachers and study department officers to
enroll students in and unenroll them from courses. Furthermore, it allows teachers to set enrollment conditions for their 
courses and checks them during enrollment. Finally, it also allows students to sign up to waiting lists and enrolls them automatically.

Users access EnrollmentSystem through different presenters which are provided to them through the SIS dashboard. The system uses Single Sing-On to verify users' identities. It interacts with the outside SIS schedule module to read current lecture and lab times, as well as with databases holding course and student information.
